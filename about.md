If you've stumbled here looking for pretty pictures and wireframes of what I've made in the past, find another designer.  I don't want to work with you.  They tend to congregate [here](http://www.dribbble.com), [here](http://www.behance.com), and [here](http://www.cargocollective.com). 

The future defines me, not the past.  While I've worked on a slew of really cool [projects](http://geoffreybyers.com/projects), my best work is yet to come.  If you want to be part of that, let's talk.  

I'm a pretty easy guy to find and I'm a blast to speak with.  I'll probably tell you what you don't want to hear, but rather what you need to hear.

Somebody said designers shouldn't code.  Fuck that guy.  This site is:

* Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com)

Cheers,
