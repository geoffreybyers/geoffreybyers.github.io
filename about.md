If you've stumbled here looking for pretty pictures and wireframes of what I've made in the past, find another designer.  There congregate on [here](http://www.dribbble.com), [here](http://www.behance.com), and [here](http://www.cargocollective.com).  I don't want to work with you.  

The past doesn't define me.  The future does.  While I've worked on a slew of really cool [projects](http://geoffreybyers.com/projects), my best work is yet to come.  

I'm pretty easy to get ahold of, though I'll probably tell you what you don't want to hear but need to:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffreybyers)
* [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffreybyers/)
* Jabber - geoffreybyers@swissjabber.ch
* Email - geoffrey@geoffreybyers.com

Somebody said designers shouldn't code.  Fuck that guy.  This site is:

* Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com)
