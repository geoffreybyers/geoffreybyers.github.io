If you've stumbled here looking for pretty pictures and wireframes of what I've made in the past, find another designer.  Aesthetically driven designers tend to congregate [here](http://www.dribbble.com), [here](http://www.behance.com), and [here](http://www.cargocollective.com).  I solve complex and sophisticated problems which tend to be elegant.  Aesthetics is just the tip of the iceburg.

The future defines me, not the past.  While I've worked on a plethora of really cool [projects](http://geoffreybyers.com/projects), my best work is yet to come.  If you want to be part of that, let's talk.  

I'm a pretty easy guy to find and I'm a blast to speak with.  I'll probably tell you what you don't want to hear, but rather what you need to hear.

Somebody said designers shouldn't code.  Fuck that guy.  This site is:

* Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com)
