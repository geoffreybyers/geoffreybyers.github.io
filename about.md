---

I'm a thinker and a doer.  A designer, builder, maker, hacker and general wearer of many hats.  I work on everything awesome.  I've help launch astronauts into space with [NASA](http://geoffreybyers.github.io/projects), save lives with [Siemens](http://geoffreybyers.github.io/projects), and I'm stirring thing up by collaborating with other startups at [Great Job](http://geoffreybyers.github.io/projects).  

I've also been a featured speaker at multiple events including Siemens UX Day, Startup Leadership Program, and the Innovation Greenhouse on top of being an [IDEA Awards finalist](http://www.idsa.org/category/tags/idea-2011-finalist-student).

##About the site##
I'm a believer in perpetuating discussions surrounding ideas as opposed to sharing aesthetically pleasing photos of wireframes.  This page in it's single column blog style is a manifestation of something I care deeply about.

Furthermore, this site is:

* Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
