If you've stumbled here looking for pretty pictures and bullshit wireframes of what I've made in the past, find another designer.  There are a ton on [here](http://www.dribbble.com), [here](http://www.behance.com), and [here](http://www.cargocollective.com).  I don't want to work with you.  

The past doesn't define me.  The future does.  While I've worked on a slew of really cool [projects](http://geoffreybyers.com/projects), my best work is yet to come.
