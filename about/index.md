![me](/assets/images/about/me_large.jpg "me")

I'm a voracious researcher, designer, maker, hacker, hustler, advisor.  I'm a founder and designer at [Great Job](http://greatjob.is) and the designer in residence at [Fort Work](http://www.fortwork.com).  I'm rather nomadic and split my time between a few of my favorite cities.

##My Flow
If you've stumbled here looking for pretty pictures and wire frames and customer journey maps relating to what I've made in the past, find another designer.  Aesthetically driven designers tend to congregate [here](http://www.dribbble.com), [here](http://www.behance.com), and [here](http://www.cargocollective.com).  That is not UX design.  I solve complex and sophisticated problems which result in elegant solutions.  Aesthetics is just the tip of the iceberg.

##The Logo
Research, Design, Code, repeat.

##My Work
The future defines me, not the past.  While I've worked on a plethora of really cool [projects](http://geoffreybyers.com/projects), my best work is yet to come.  If you want to be part of something radical, let's talk.
