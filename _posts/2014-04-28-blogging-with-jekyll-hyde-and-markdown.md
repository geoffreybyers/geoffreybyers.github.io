title: Blogging with Jekyll and Hyde
---

I got tired of wordpress.  The minimalist in me was looking for an alternative to the bloated platform rich with tools and plugins.  I wanted something that worked, was lightweight and simple to use once set up.  I have been experimenting with Great Job's blog for some time.  I wanted to install Ghost, Anchor CMS or Jekyll but was deterred by the setup process.  I experimented with and settled on Dropplets by Circa75 Media.  At the time it was a straightforward install onto our host server.

I've been embracing coding over the last year and decided I wanted to take full control over my personal site and blog, using it as a test case for Great Job and clients.  Jekyll was fairly easy to get up and running once I got Ruby updated and RVM and the jekyll ruby gem installed correctly.  To keep things aesthetically pleasing and moving quickly, my coworking mate <a href="http://www.amirrajan.net">Amir Rajan</a> recommended I go with Hyde.  I choose to host both on github pages again for the low barrier of entry.  I'm modifying the css and html as I go, however things were up and running in a number of hours.  Without the ruby and first time hiccups - a matter of minutes.

If you're up for the challenge of coding a bit and rolling something custom for you, give Jekyll a spin.

Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll">Jekyll team</a>, and <a href="http://markdotto.com/">Mark Dotto</a> for Hyde.
